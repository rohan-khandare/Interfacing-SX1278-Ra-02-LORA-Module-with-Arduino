LoRa (Long Range) is a wireless communication technology designed for long-range, low-power, and low-data-rate applications. It is commonly used in Internet of Things (IoT) devices to transmit small amounts of data over long distances, making it ideal for sensor networks, smart cities, and remote monitoring systems.

# Key Features:
Long Range: Capable of transmitting data over distances of several kilometers, even in challenging environments.
Low Power: Designed for low energy consumption, allowing devices to operate on batteries for years.
Low Data Rate: Suitable for applications that require the transmission of small amounts of data, such as sensor readings.

# Applications:
- Smart agriculture
- Environmental monitoring
- Smart cities
- Asset tracking
- Industrial IoT
LoRa operates in unlicensed radio frequency bands, such as 433 MHz, 868 MHz, and 915 MHz, depending on the region. It uses a modulation technique called Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) to achieve long-range communication with robustness against interference.
